/*
This program configures the bluetooth module with custom name and pin for
use with the Arduino Pedelec Controller

1st step: Connect Bluetooth module to Arduino Pedelec Controller
2nd step: Wait 1 minute after uploading the program (bluetooth module should
shut down and repower during this time), then you are ready.
